# Countdown Timer

The Countdown Timer is a simple web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to set a specific countdown duration and displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Once the countdown is completed, it presents a congratulations message and shows the elapsed time since the countdown finished. This was my one of my first projects, so this is a countdown until the end of General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp (Shout out to SEI 306)


## Installation

To use the Countdown Timer, follow these steps:
```
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the files to a directory of your choice.
```
Since the app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can run it directly in your web browser.
## Usage/Examples

1. In the ```script.js ``` in line 2 put the date you are looking to develop the countdown till.

2. You can then open the ```index.html``` to see the tinme needed until that date arrives. 

3. You can also go to line 33 in the HTML and update the ```desk.jpg``` to whatever image you desire.
## Features

- Add a countdown date and time
- Formatted date structure so you can see the goal
- Whenever you revisit it will show how many days it has been since you've reached the countdown date.
